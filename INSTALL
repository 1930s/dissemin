dissem.in is split in two parts:
- the web frontend, powered by Django
- the tasks backend, powered by Celery

Installing the tasks backend requires additional dependencies and
is not necessary if you want to do light dev that does not require
harvesting metadata or running author disambiguation.

EASY INSTALLATION METHOD
========================

Use the VirtualBox virtual machine provided.

1. Install VirtualBox
2. Download http://dev.dissem.in/files/DisseminVM.ova
3. Run the VM and login to it with user and pass "dissemin"
4. Go to the local copy, directory "~/dissemin"
5. Update the local copy by running ./pull_and_update.sh
6. Run the server with "python manage.py runserver"
7. You can see the result on http://localhost:8000/ (from both the VM and the host)

You can also connect to the guest from the host on port 8022. By default, for
security reasons, the SSH server and Web server only listen to connections from
the host.

If you wish to allow other machines to access the SSH or Web server, you can
configure this in VirtualBox: in the contextual menu Devices > Network > Network
Settings..., click "Port Forwarding" and remove "127.0.0.1" from the "Host IP"
columns for services that should listen for connections from other machines.


Installation instructions for the web frontend
==============================================


First, install the following dependencies (debian packages)

postgresql
postgresql-server-dev-all
postgresql-client
python-virtualenv
build-essential
libxml2-dev
libxslt1-dev
python-dev
gettext
libmagickwand-dev

-----------
Then, build a virtual environment to isolate all the python dependencies.

* virtualenv .virtualenv
* source .virtualenv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements_frontend.txt
* touch romeo_api_key
* git clone https://github.com/threonorm/django-cas /tmp/django-cas
* cd /tmp/django-cas 
* python setup.py install

------
Setting the database

sudo su postgres
psql
CREATE USER dissemin WITH PASSWORD 'dissemin';
ALTER USER dissemin CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE dissemin WITH OWNER dissemin;

	ctrl+d


---Download a backup.gz of the database on ulminfo.fr

(to be run as "postgres" user)
$ gunzip backup.gz
$ cat backup | psql dissemin

Then, the server can be launched with:

$ python manage.py runserver

and can be accessed at:
http://localhost:8000/

Installation instructions for the tasks backend
===============================================

The backend communicates with the frontend through AMQP. The default settings are
configured to use RabbitMQ, an AMQP server.

# apt-get install rabbitmq-server

(this launches the rabbitmq server)

Install Python dependencies:

$ sudo apt-get install libxml2 python-dev libxslt-dev liblapack-dev gfortran libopenblas-dev
$ source .virtualend/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements_backend.txt

Optional python dependencies (if you want to debug the learning system):
$ pip install nltk
$ pip install matplotlib


To run the backend (still in the virtualenv):

$ celery --app=dissemin.celery:app worker -B -l INFO
