Installation
============

dissem.in is split in two parts:
- the web frontend, powered by Django;
- the tasks backend, powered by Celery.

Installing the tasks backend requires additional dependencies and is not
necessary if you want to do light dev that does not require harvesting
metadata or running author disambiguation.

Installation instructions for the web frontend
----------------------------------------------

First, install the following dependencies (debian packages)
``postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-client python-virtualenv build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev gettext``

Then, build a virtual environment to isolate all the python
dependencies::

   virtualenv .virtualenv
   source .virtualenv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements_frontend.txt

Set up the database
-------------------

Choose a unique database and user name (they can be identical), such as
``dissemin_myuni``. Choose a strong password for your user::

   sudo su postgres
   psql
   CREATE USER dissemin_myuni WITH PASSWORD 'b3a55787b3adc3913c2129205821765d';
   ALTER USER dissemin_myuni CREATEDB;
   CREATE DATABASE dissemin_myuni WITH OWNER dissemin_myuni;

Configure the settings
----------------------

Edit ``dissemin/settings.py`` to change the following settings:

- Set up the university branding, defining:
    - ``UNIVERSITY_FULL_NAME``: the complete name of the university;
    - ``UNIVERSITY_SHORT_NAME``: the short name (with determiner);
    - ``UNIVERSITY_REPOSITORY_URL``: the address of your university's
      institutional repository, if it has one. This is not intended to
      be the url of an API, simply the address where to redirect users
      to when they want to see the repository;
    - ``UNIVERSITY_URL``: the website of your university.

- (Optional) Set up the SMTP parameters to send emails to authors, in
  the ``EMAIL`` section.

- ``CORE_API_KEY`` and ``ROMEO_API_KEYS`` are required if you want to
  import papers automatically from these sources. See :ref:`page-apikeys`
  about how to get them. The ``ZENODO_KEY`` is required
  if you want to upload papers to Zenodo.

- Create a fresh ``SECRET_KEY`` (any random-looking string that you can keep secret will
  do).

- Set ``DEBUG`` to ``False`` if your website will be available from anywhere. (Keep ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``
  to ``True``).

- Add the domain you will be using (for instance ``myuni.dissem.in``) to the ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``.

- Set up the URL of your Central Authentication System in
  ``CAS_URL``.

- Fill the DATABASES section with the details you chose in the
  previous step

- Create a ``www/static`` directory and set the ``STATIC_ROOT``
  variable to the global path for this folder. For instance, if your
  local copy of dissemin is in ``/home/me/dissemin``, set ``STATIC_ROOT = '/home/me/dissemin/www/static'``.



You should commit these changes on a separate branch, let's call it
``prod``::

   git checkout -b prod
   git add dissemin/settings.py
   commit -m "Production settings"

Create the database structure
-----------------------------

This is done by applying migrations::

   python manage.py migrate

(this should be done every time the source code is updated).
Then you can move on to :ref:`page-importresearchers`
and :ref:`page-deploying`.

Optional: installing the tasks backend
--------------------------------------

The backend communicates with the frontend through a message passing
infrastructure. TODO: link to the Django doc for that.
We recommend redis.
TODO:Â update the rest of the doc
The default
settings are configured to use RabbitMQ, an AMQP server::

   apt-get install rabbitmq-server

(this launches the rabbitmq server). Install Python dependencies::

   sudo apt-get install libxml2 python-dev libxslt-dev liblapack-dev gfortran libopenblas-dev
   source .virtualend/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements_backend.txt

Optional python dependencies (if you want to debug the learning system)::
   pip install nltk
   pip install matplotlib

To run the backend (still in the virtualenv)::
   celery --app=dissemin.celery:app worker -B -l INFO
