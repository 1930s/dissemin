Many institutions adopt open access policies, requiring researchers to
make their articles freely available in a repository. Enforcing these
policies is far from straightforward however: according to a recent
study in the UK , each article costs an estimated 33 GBP of staff time
to ensure compliance with the RCUK policy.  Researchers often consider
these policies as a burden: they need to understand the requirements
of their publishers and their institutions, and to spend time
uploading their articles to various repositories, with the appropriate
metadata.

We propose to lower these barriers with dissem.in, a platform that
leverages various metadata sources to get a clear picture of the
access status of publications.  The platform allows researchers and
librarians to search for papers filtered by two criteria: full text
availability in open repositories and publisher preprint policy. This
enables us to compute a list of papers that are not available in
repositories yet, but that could safely be uploaded to repositories
given the preprint policy of the publisher.  We expect such a tool to
be very useful when enforcing open access policies, especially when
there is no designated repository where researchers have to upload
their works.

The web platform is a free software still under development, and is
being tested at École Normale Supérieure, a french university, to
implement an open access policy. A proof of concept is running at
http://ens.dissem.in/ and encompasses a few departments in this
university.

There are many technical challenges behind such a project, the first
one being the processing of gigabytes of data, available from
disparate sources in heterogeneous formats. The second one is that
author names are ambiguous and noisy: some names are widespread,
and researchers change name, for instance when they get married.
We address this problem using a novel machine learning algorithm
that groups similar papers together and assesses their relevance for
the department of the candidate author.
