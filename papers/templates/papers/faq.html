        <h3>Open Access</h3>

        <h2 id="open-access">{% trans "What is Open Access?" %}</h2>
        <p>
        In a nutshell, the Open Access movement promotes free access to the scientific literature. For a 
        more in-depth introduction, we recommend
        <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1533">this video in English</a>
            and
            <a href="http://pablo.rauzy.name/openaccess/introduction.html">this introduction in French</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="repositories-rock">Why should I upload my papers to a repository?</h2>
        <p>
        You should do it because:
        <ul>
            <li>It makes your research <strong>more accessible</strong> and <strong>more visible</strong>.
            Many researchers routinely check papers in topic repositories such as arXiv, and
            it is less likely that these researchers check your homepage regularly.
              </li>
              <li>You can even do it before publication. You can get <strong>valuable feedback</strong>
              to improve your paper before the actual peer-reviewing process. It also witnesses the fact
              that you have had your ideas earlier than the actual publication time.</li>
              <li>
              It provides you a <strong>durable storage</strong>. Your homepage
              is likely to change or to disappear, for instance if you leave your current institution.
              </li>
              <li>
              Some publishers do not allow preprints on homepages but allow them in
              repositories.</li>
              <li>
              Finally, for all these reasons,
              an increasing number of <strong>funding bodies</strong> require the outcomes of
              their projects to be available in a repository.
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-repository">What repository should I use?</h2>
        <p>
            There are roughly two types of repositories:
            <ul>
                <li>Subject repositories, restricted to some research fields, such as <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>.</li>
                <li>Institutional repositories, designated to store the research output of a given institution or country.
                    For instance, ENS has <a href="http://hal-ens.archives-ouvertes.fr/">its own repository</a> integrated in
                    <a href="http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/">HAL</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If your research community favours a specific repository, using it makes sense as it will increase your
            visibility. If not, institutional repositories are also a good option. 
        </p>

        <h3>Dissem.in</h3>
        <h2 id="what-is-dissemin">{% trans "What is dissem.in?" %}</h2>
        <p>Dissem.in is a web platform gathering metadata from <a href="{% url 'sources' %}">various sources</a>
        and analyzing the full text availability of publications of researchers, currently only within the ENS.
        It has been designed to foster the use of repositories (rather than preprints posted on personal homepages),
        <a href="#repositories-rock">for numerous reasons</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="repository">{% trans "Is dissem.in a repository?" %}</h2>
        <p>Dissem.in is not a repository as it does not store any full text. When the full text of a publication
        is available, a link to the relevant page is provided.</p>
        <h2 id="running">{% trans "Who runs dissem.in?" %}</h2>
        <p>Dissem.in is currently run by its developper, <a href="http://antonin.delpeuch.eu">Antonin Delpeuch</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="creating-a-profile">{% trans "Can I create my profile on dissem.in?" %}</h2>
        <p>If your institution is not covered by dissem.in, currently, no, you cannot.
        Our algorithms require some information about your department and research field
        to gather your publications.</p>
        <h2 id="new-institution">{% trans "Can I use dissem.in for my institution?" %}</h2>
        <p>Yes, just ask <a href="mailto:contact@dissem.in">contact@dissem.in</a>.</p>

        <h3>Policies and full-text availability</h3>
        <h2 id="policy-classes">{% trans "What do your policy classes mean?" %}</h2>
        <h2 id="availability">{% trans "When is a paper considered available?" %}</h2>
        <p>When we have found it in one of the repositories we harvest. The list of
        these repositories can be found <a href="{% url "sources" %}">here</a>.
        Thanks to <a href="http://www.base-search.net">the BASE search engine</a>,
        we cover more than 68 millions of preprints.</p>
        <h2 id="statistics">{% trans "Should I trust your statistics?" %}</h2>
        <p>There are a few caveats concerning our data:
        <ul>
            <li>Some papers are not present in any of our metadata sources, so they are not counted at all ;</li>
            <li>Some entries in our system do not correspond to proper research papers ;</li>
            <li>Some of them have been incorrectly classified by our homonym disambiguation system ;</li>
            <li>Some repositories might not be covered by any of our sources, so a paper might be marked as unavailable while it is available ;</li>
            <li>Some papers might be marked as available but actually, they are not (for instance because the content has been deleted) ;</li>
            <li>And many other technical issues.</li>
        </ul>
        But our platform is increasingly reliable and we think that department-wise statistics are meaningful.</p>

        <h3>Omissions and errors</h3>
        <h2 id="missing-paper">{% trans "One of my papers is missing. Why?" %}</h2>
            <p>There are many possible reasons: maybe it is not available from any
               of <a href="{% url 'sources' %}">our sources</a>, your name is spelt
               differently or partially in the authors list, our algorithms estimated
               that it has been written by an homonym researcher, or it has been deleted
               by one of your co-authors.</p>
            <p>In any case, you should be able to add it manually soon.</p>

        <h2 id="incorrect-metadata">{% trans "Some details of my paper are incorrect. What can I do?" %}</h2>
            <p>In a near future, you should be able to create an account and fix it by yourself.
               If it is really urgent, send a message to contact@dissem.in.</p>

       <h2 id="copy-available">{% trans "There is a freely available copy of my article online but Dissem.in does not find it." %}</h2>
            <p>There are two cases:
            <ul>
                    <li>Your article is available on a personal homepage or a similar
                    website. In this case, you should read <a href="#repositories-rock">
                        why you should also put it in a repository</a>.</li>
                    <li>Your article is available in a repository but does not appear as
                     available in dissem.in. In this case you should send a message
                     to <a href="mailto:contact@dissem.in">contact@dissem.in</a> to fix the problem.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <h3>Behind the scene</h3>

        <h2 id="sources">{% trans "Where do you get the data from?" %}</h2>
            <p>Our sources are listed on <a href="{% url 'sources' %}">this page</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="getting-involved">{% trans "How can I help?" %}</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to get involved, even if you do not want to write any code.
        <ul>
            <li>Tell us what you think:Â <a href="mailto:contact@dissem.in">contact@dissem.in</a> ;</li>
            <li>Help us to tag articles to improve our author disambiguation algorithm ;</li>
            <li>Help us with the overall usability of the website ;</li>
            <li>Help us with the translation of the interface ;</li>
            <li>Help us to get lists of researchers from departments ;</li>
            <li>Fix metadata errors (you have to get an account for that) ;</li>
            <li>Spread the word about this tool ;</li>
            <li>Star <a href="http://github.com/wetneb/dissemin">our github project</a>!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="source-code">{% trans "Where is the source code?" %}</h2>
        <p>The source code is available <a href="http://github.com/wetneb/dissemin">on github</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="oai">{% trans "Can I harvest your data?" %}</h2>
        <p>Yes! But we have not implemented any API yet. Tell us what you need.</p>
        <h2 id="bikes">{% trans "Do you like bicycles?" %}</h2>
        <p>Yes! Bikes are awesome. You should like them too.</p>
